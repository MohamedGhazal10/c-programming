Grading at Wed May  6 08:18:35 UTC 2020
I expected to find a file called 'squares_test.o' but it did not exist
(or was not a regular file)
Here are the files that I can find:
ans_3_5_8_2.txt
ans_5_2_4_6.txt
ans_9_2_3_4.txt
grade.txt
myout.txt
README
squares.c
Cannot proceed without squares_test.o

Overall Grade: FAILED
